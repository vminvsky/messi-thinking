TODO:
- reformat the vllm generation script for the single model inference. 

measuring similarity:
- cosine similarity 
- entropy across the generations 

1. open-ended generation. 
- give the models 10 stories.
- have them generate 100 samples for each story. 


2. correctness 
- include some tasks where we want to test how well the model performs.
- eleutherai harness 
- best-of-n sampling

intra-story similarity
inter-story similarity
